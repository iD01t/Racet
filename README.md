### Notes:
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: The content is formatted with consistent spacing and line breaks, ready to be copied directly into a GitHub `README.md` file.
- **Formatting**: Uses single asterisks (`*`) for headings and emphasis, as requested, avoiding `##` and `**`. Code blocks and links are preserved for functionality.
- **GitHub Compatibility**: Renders cleanly on GitHub with proper Markdown syntax.
- **No Changes to Content**: The text and structure are identical to the previous version, only the heading and emphasis styles have been adjusted.

If you need additional files (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.env.example`) or further modifications (e.g., removing all emphasis or changing heading styles), please let me know!
